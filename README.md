# Arken: Evolution Isles

## Protocol

This is basically shared schemas, types, and RPC calls.

## Realm

This is basically the entry point for the player, it routes them to a shard.

## Shard

This is basically the game server, runs logic, coordinates with the realm server, etc.

## Client

This is the main client built in Unity, but since it has purchased assets, you'll have to request repo access in Telegram: telegram.arken.gg
